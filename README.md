# Isabella_et_al_2021

This folder contains code for the quantification of vagus nerve topography by branch-specific phoconversion, as reported in the Isabella et al. 2021 publication. The "Julien_combo.m" matlab script provides a simple means to run the other provided matlab scripts, which will generate raw cumulative density and midpoint data for selected microscopy images. The "backfill graphs summary.py" script can then be run to generate normalized cumulative density data.
